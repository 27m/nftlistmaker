# NFT List Maker

NFT List Maker is a simple python script used to make NFT Lists for tradebots. (ex. OTB, Gear5 and Vector)

It relies on the [Rolimon's Item API](https://www.rolimons.com/itemapi/itemdetails) to fetch details of every single limited item on the catalog. 

## What is a NFT list?

A NFT list tells your tradebot what items you don't want to send trades for / accept on. This is crucial for tradebotting so that you don't take losses and accept projected or fluctuating items.

## This program is a work in progress!

Roadmap:

I plan to utilize a proxy and cache data from the Rolimon's API then fetch from this proxy through the program. 

The program will eventually auto-update / replace your tradebot config's previous NFT list.
